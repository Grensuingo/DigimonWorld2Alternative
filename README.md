=-=-= Details =-=-=

Digimon World 2 Alternative aims to be a new Digimon World 2 experience for both seasoned veterans
of the game, as well as newer players! 

=-=-= Changes & Features =-=-=

The story of Digimon World 2 Alternative has been changed to follow a similar path as the original
while having a different interpretation to various events throughout the course of the game.
The overall difficulty attempts to gradually increase as the game progresses, contrasting the original
where the difficulty caps out at a certain point and stays the same for the rest of the game.

Along the journey, enemy Digimon encounters and bosses have been revised and updated. Digivolutions
for all Digimon have been altered, including the results from DNA-Digivolutions. Digimon skills for
use in battle have had their AP, MP costs, and effects altered with the menus and battle UI updated
to support viewing these stats easier. The trades that open up at various points in the game have had
their required and received Digimon changed.

A Digimon Re-name attendant was placed in the Coloseum sign-up area to allow players to re-name their
Digimon; A feature missing from the original!

On the journey, wild Digimon teams consisting of mixed types may be found. Mixed type enemy teams can only
be recruited with the Toy Gifts that work on All Types of Digimon.
